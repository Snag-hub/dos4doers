# DayOS: Project Overview

## 🌟 Vision
DayOS is a **productivity system** designed to bridge the gap between "Capture" and "Action". Unlike traditional read-later apps that become graveyards for links, or to-do apps that lack context, DayOS treats every captured item (Article, Video, Task, Meeting) as a time-based commitment.

**Core Philosophy:**
1.  **Capture Everything**: Frictionless saving from browser/mobile.
2.  **Plan Reality**: Everything has a "When".
3.  **Nudge, Don't Spam**: Smart notification loops (Push + Email) that respect your schedule.

## 🏗 Architecture

### Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion.
-   **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions, Drizzle ORM.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon/Supabase).
-   **Auth**: Clerk.
-   **Notifications**:
    -   **Push**: Web Push Protocol (VAPID) + Service Workers.
    -   **Email**: Nodemailer (SMTP/Mailjet) + Custom HTML Templates.
    -   **Cron**: External Cron Service (triggering Vercel API routes).
-   **Browser Extension**: Chrome/Firefox Manifest V3 (JS, CSS).

### Key Systems
1.  **Capture Pipeline**:
    -   User saves URL via Extension/App.
    -   System fetches Metadata (OG Tags, Title, Image).
    -   Item saved to `items` table.
2.  **Notification Engine**:
    -   **Cron Job** runs daily/hourly.
    -   Checks `items` (assignments) and `reminders` (adhoc).
    -   Groups notifications by User.
    -   Sends **Email Digest** (with branding/favicons).
    -   Sends **Push Notification** (clickable).
    -   **Auto-Cleanup**: One-time reminders are deleted; Recurring ones rescheduled.
